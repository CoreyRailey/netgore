NetGore is a free, open source online RPG engine created with C# and SFML. It is designed to provide a strong and flexible foundation for your own 2d online games. While the focus is towards side-scrolling and top-down RPGs, it can still be used to create any kind of 2d game that does not require very low latency (shooters) and uses the client-server model.

Anyone may download and use NetGore for whatever project they wish. If you wish to contribute with development, please see the following page:

**NOTE TO PEOPLE ADDING ISSUES:** If an issue has my username as the owner (mr.spodi), then I will get to it eventually. If I do not put my name as the owner of an issue, that means someone else took it from me so they can work on it, or nobody is working on it. Issues related to usability of the demo game and editor interface stuff is accepted, but I do not usually bother with it. It is up to other people to help out with these things.
